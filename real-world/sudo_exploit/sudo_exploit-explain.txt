Please provide an explanation about how you construct your solution (the program name): 
  for exploit1
  >> cd /home/student/A2/PartB/sudo_exploit
  >> ./sudo_exploit1.sh


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart1)
  overwrite userdetails.uid -> 0, 
  to find userdetails.sh: (gdb) p &userdetails;
  to find written-in getprogname addr: find from the args of easprintf(); 


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart2)


- Did you meet the problem that addresses inside/outside GDB are different? Is that a problem or how did you overcome it?
  In the first subpart, the ASLR is closed, therefore no difference;

- Other comments:  
  cannot do part 2...
