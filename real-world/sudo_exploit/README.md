## Important Notes about `sudo`

- You can use the source code folder `../sudo` for debugging. But you SHOULD NOT compile and install the code. Those binaries are compiled with a different compiler. Compile and install them will change the vulnerable program.

- The default `sudo` in the system is not changed. The vulnerable `sudo` is copied to `/usr/local/libexec/sudo` instead. This file is the vulnerable target, not the default `sudo` in the system.

- The code for copying the vulnerable `sudo` to `/usr/local/libexec/sudo` is placed here for a reference. This is already done by TA. You don't need to run it.

    ```
    mkdir /usr/local/libexec
    chmod 755 /usr/local/libexec

    cp ../sudo/plugins/sudoers/.libs/sudoers.so /usr/local/libexec/sudoers.so
    chown root:root /usr/local/libexec/sudoers.so
    chmod 755 /usr/local/libexec/sudoers.so

    cp ../sudo/src/sudo /usr/local/libexec/sudo
    chown root:root /usr/local/libexec/sudo
    chmod 4755 /usr/local/libexec/sudo
    ```

- Only one line in the exploit script  `YOUR_SOLUTION="..."` is extracted for evaluation. The automated evaluation is using different scripts and copy your `YOUR_SOLUTION="..."` in. Please keep your solution in that line.

- Automated evaluation will run `YOUR_SOLUTION` as `student` user with a different `test.sh` that will read some random secret file.
