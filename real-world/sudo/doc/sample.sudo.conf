#   Path askpass /path/to/askpass
#   Path noexec /path/to/noexec.so
#
# Sudo plugins:
#
# The plugin_path is relative to ${prefix}/libexec unless fully qualified.
# The plugin_name corresponds to a global symbol in the plugin
#   that contains the plugin interface structure.
#
# The sudoers plugin is used by default if no Plugin lines are present.

#
# Sudo askpass:
#
# An askpass helper program may be specified to provide a graphical
# password prompt for "sudo -A" support.  Sudo does not ship with its
# own passpass program but can use the OpenSSH askpass.
#
# Use the OpenSSH askpass
#Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass
#
# Use the Gnome OpenSSH askpass
#Path askpass /usr/libexec/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass

#
# Sudo noexec:
#
# Path to a shared library containing dummy versions of the execv(),
# execve() and fexecve() library functions that just return an error.
# This is used to implement the "noexec" functionality on systems that
# support C<LD_PRELOAD> or its equivalent.
# The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
# if you rename or move the sudo_noexec.so file.
#
#Path noexec /usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so
