# System-Security-Exploit-Practice
Practiced several system security exploits with C language in a specific Linux image (https://drive.google.com/file/d/16WntAiUy3R-uR8M0C4kWJUu8WNLqdfFf/view), most of which aim to achieve root privileges or tamper with some data, breaking the integrity or/and the confidentiality of the system.   Some general techniques applied to the vulnerable custom programs include stack overflow, integer overflow, format string tricks,  double free, return-to-libc, rop.   More than that, some vulnerabilities once existed in the real-world Linux versions are also exploited, including SUDO and GHTTPD.
