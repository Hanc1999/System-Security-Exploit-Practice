# Important Notes about `ghttpd`

- You can use the source code folder `../ghttpd` for debugging. But you SHOULD NOT compile and install the ghttpd. Compile and install them will change the vulnerable program.

- For the subpart1, you might need an executable stack. You can use the `execstack` to modify the ghttpd binary.

- The ghttpd is installed at `/usr/local/ghttpd`. You can use `start.sh`, `stop.sh` and `attach.sh` to start it, stop it or attach to it. To use those scripts you might need to manually input the pid. You can also write your own scripts to facilitate debugging.

- For subpart1 you should use control-flow attack. For subpart2 you should use data-oriented attack, and you should not change any return address.

- **Notes for auto evaluation (You can check this after you have finished this task):** the automated evaluation of this task is copying everything to /tmp folder. If your solution works locally but not in the online judge, you can simulate the evaluation setting by running `simulate_eval_env.sh` and change the `start.sh` to run the ghttpd in /tmp folder to see if there's a problem.
